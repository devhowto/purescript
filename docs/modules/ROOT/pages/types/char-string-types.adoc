= Char and String Types

== Char

The `Char` type is written in single quotes.
We can also use Unicode code points in hexadecimal to create a char.
Note the `\x...` escape sequence.

[source,haskell]
----
charZ :: Char
charZ = 'Z'

check :: Char
check = '\x2714'
-- â†’ âœ”
----

== String

The `String` type is written with double quotes.

Unlike in some other languages, line continuation requires not one escape, but two.

[source,haskell]
----
hello :: String
hello = "Hello, world!"

withNl :: String
withNl = "Contains a\nnewline."
----

Multi-line:

[source,haskell]
----
multi :: String
multi = "This string\
        \ spawns over\
        \ multiple lines, but spaces\
        \ to the \
        \ left of the â€˜\\â€™ are ignored.\
        \\n\
        \ Oh, and Unicode code points\
        \ work too \x2714! ðŸ’–"
----

[source,text]
----
> log multi
This string spawns over multiple lines, but spaces to the left of the â€˜\â€™ are ignored.
 Oh, and Unicode code points work too âœ”! ðŸ’–
----

Spaces before the trailing `\` concatenate with spaces after the leading `\`.

== Unicode

We can use `\x` escapes with hexadecimal numbers to denote a Unicode code point.

=== Char

For `Char`, as of PureScript 0.15, it seems we can use up to 4 bytes:

[source,text]
----
> '\x2714'
'âœ”'

> '\x2717'
'âœ—'

> '\x03bb'
'Î»'

> '\x203d'
'â€½'

> '\x0001f4a9'
Unexpected a at line 1, column 10
> '\x1f4a9'
Illegal astral code point in character literal at line 1, column 9
----

=== String

For `String`, we can use up to 6 bytes (which as of 2022, is enough every Unicode code point without using surrogates, since as of this day, Unicode goes up to 10FFFF).

[source,text]
----
> "\x2714"
"âœ”"

> "\x1f4a9"
"ðŸ’©"

> "\x01f4a9"
"ðŸ’©"

> "\x0001f4a9"
"ðŸ’©"
----

Surrogates work with `String`, but not with `Char`:

....
> "\xD83d\xDCA9"
"ðŸ’©"

> '\xD83d\xDCA9'
Unexpected \ at line 1, column 8
....
