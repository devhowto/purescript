= Simple Types | PureScript

== Numbers

Numbers can be of type `Number` and `Int`. Both are represented as
normal JavaScript numbers at runtime. `Int`, however, has operations
defined differently so that we always get integer results:

[source,haskell]
----
> div 7 2
3

> mod 7 2
1

> div 7.0 2.0
3.5

> mod 7.0 2.0
0.0
----

Note how `div 7 2` results in 3, rather than 3.5. A number _without_ a
decimal is always considered an `Int`, while a number _with_ a decimal
is always considered a `Number`. Exponential notation always means the
type is `Number`:

[source,haskell]
----
> 1
1

> :type 1
Int

> 1.0
1.0

> :type 1.0
Number

> 1e0
1.0

> :type 1e0
Number

> 1e-2
0.01

> :type 1e-2
Number
----

They Int-typed operations are made to return integers with some use of
bitwise operators, as we can see in
`.spago/prelude/v6.0.0/src/Data/Ring.js`:

[source,js]
----
export const intSub = function (x) {
  return function (y) {
    return x - y | 0;
  };
};
----

== Typing a number

As we saw, 1 is `Int`, while `1.0` or `1e0` is `Number`. We cannot force
a value like `1` to be `Number` simply by adding a type annotation like
in Haskell.

[source,haskell]
----
n :: Number
n = 1
----

The above will produce an error:

`Could not match type   Could not match type     Int   with type     Number while checking that type Int   is at least as general as type Number while checking that expression 1   has type Number in value declaration n PureScript(TypesDoNotUnify)`

== Negative Numbers

To make negative numbers, use the unary `-` operator (requires
parenthesis) or the `negate` function.

[source,purescript]
----
> 1 + (-1)        
0

> 1 + negate 1    
0
----
