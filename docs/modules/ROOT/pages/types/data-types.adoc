= Data Types

To create a new Data Type we use the `data` keyword:

[source,haskell]
----
data Foo = Foo

x :: Foo
x = Foo
----

image::data-types-1.svg[Data Types Example 1]

The type `Foo` has one inhabitant, `Foo`.

We can use the same name on the left, as the Data Type, and on the right as the Data Constructor because they are stored in different namespaces.

== Product and Coproduct types

If some type can be either one or the other, but not both, it is a _coproduct_ (sum type), also called _union_ type.
In Set Theory, an _union_ operation is an `OR` operation.

The _hello world_ of data types is defining our own version of true and false:

[source,haskell]
----
data Bool = T | F

f :: Bool
f = F

t :: Bool
t = T
----

`Bool` is the _data type_ and `T` and `F` are the _data constructors_ (the two values that inhabit the `Bool` type).

A given `v :: Bool` can be either `F` *or* `T` but not both at the same time.
In Set Theory, a _union_ is an _OR_ operation, generally denoted by `|` or `||` in programming languages.

[source,haskell]
----
data ReasonToCancel
  = TooManyEmails
  | NotInterested
  | Other String

answer :: ReasonToCancel
answer = Other "I don't like email ads..."
----

The data constructor `Other` in `ReasonToCancel` data type is actually a function which implies:

[source,haskell]
----
Other :: String -> ReasonToCancel
----

That is, the function `Other` is a function from `String` to `ReasonToCancel`.
It maps one type to another.

== Type Variables

We can make the `Other` data constructor take a type we donâ€™t know yet, instead of hard-coding it as `String`:

[source,haskell]
----
data WhyCancel a -- <1>
  = TooManyEmails
  | NotInterested
  | Other a -- <2>

becauseWithString :: WhyCancel String -- <3>
becauseWithString = Other "I don't like email ads."

type Reason = { code :: Int, text :: String }

becauseWithReason :: Reason -- <4>
becauseWithReason =
  { code: 7
  , text: "I don't like ads."
  }
----

Note the `a` *type variable* in 1 and 2.
It means when we type something as `WhyCancel`, it takes a _type variable_, that is, some type, which is what we do in 3 and 4.

== :kind

As explained in the book Haskell From First Principles:

[quote, Haskell From First Principles]
____
Kinds are types one level up.
____

In other words, _kinds_ are types of types.
Try this in the REPL:

[source,haskell-repl]
----
> import WhyCancel

> :kind WhyCancel
Type -> Type

> :kind WhyCancel Int
Type
----

In the first case, we get `Type -> Type`, which means `WhyCancel` is not fully realised; it still requires some type to produce the final (concrete, realised) type.
In the second case, we get `Type`, which means it has been fully realised and we are at a final, concrete type.

We can, of course, create a type alias for it:

[source,haskell-repl]
----
> type T = WhyCancel String
> :kind T
Type
----

== More examples

[source,haskell]
----
data Thing
  = Foo
  | Bar
  | Sth String

sth :: Thing
sth = Sth "Takes a String"
----

`Thing` is the data type, and `Foo`, `Bar` and `Sth` are data constructors.
The data constructor `Sth` takes `String`.
Now, consider this:

[source,haskell]
----
type Jedi = { id :: Int, name :: String }

data Thing a
  = Foo
  | Bar
  | Sth a

sthStr :: Thing String
sthStr = Sth "a string"

sthInt :: Thing Int
sthInt = Sth 1

sthJedi :: Thing Jedi
sthJedi = Sth { id: 1, name: "Ahsoka Tano" }
----

By making `Thing` take a _polymorphic type variable_, we can construct data of different types.
