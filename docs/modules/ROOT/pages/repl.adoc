= Read, Eval, Print, Loop: REPL

*NOTE*: Assume `import Prelude` in all examples unless otherwise noted.

== Intro

[NOTE]
====
It takes some practice to get familiar about when you can use one of `:type` or `:kind` to inspect types, values, expressions and constructors.
Just keep on keeping on ðŸ™‚.

== :type

According to the help, `:type` is for **expressions**:

.Use :type for expressions
----
> :type 'a'
Char

> :type "w" 
String

> :type 'w'
Char

> :type "w"
String

> :type 1
Int

> :type 3.14
Number

> :type []
forall (t1 :: Type). Array t1
----

Then we try something like:

[source,text]
----
> :type 1 .. 3
  Unknown operator (..)

> :type range 1 3
  Unknown operator (..)
----

Wait! `1 .. 3` *is* an expression, and so is `range 1 3`.
We just need to import `range` and its synonym `..` from some module that offers a `range` function:

.import range and ..
----
> import Data.List (range, (..)) >
:type 1 .. 3 List Int

:type range 1 3 List Int
----

The fact is that `..` is an infix synonym (or *alias* if you will) for `range`.

Since `range` is a function, it is a value, an since `..` is a synonym for `range`, `..` is a value too.
Just remember that most non alphabetic function names are generally infix, and to get info on infix *operators*, we generally need to enclose them inside parenthesis:

----
> :type ..
Unexpected or mismatched indentation at line 1, column 1

> :type (..)
Int -> Int -> List Int
----

See how the same error and solution applies for `compose`, for example:

[source,text]
----
> :type <<<  
Unexpected or mismatched indentation at line 1, column 1

> :type (<<<)
forall (t33 :: Type) (a :: t33 -> t33 -> Type) (b :: t33) (c :: t33) (d :: t33). Semigroupoid @t33 a => a c d -> a b c -> a b d
----

You can take a look at `..` in
https://pursuit.purescript.org/packages/purescript-arrays/6.0.1/docs/Data.Array#v:(..)[Pursuit].
Click view source and see it is defined as:

[source,haskell]
----
infix 8 range as ..
----

== :kind

As seen earlier, `:kind` shows the kind of a type.

It works for the types and type constructors. For example:

[source,text]
----
> :kind Array
Type -> Type
----

It means `Array` is a type constructor that is not fully realized (it means it is awaiting for more types) that takes a type which then return the fully realized type.

If we say `Array`, it is an array of what?
Numbers? Chars? Strings?
Or an array of lists?
Or even an array of arrays?
We donâ€™t know that by simply saying `Array`.
It needs a further type in order to be fully realized:

----
> :kind Array Char
Type

> :kind Array String
Type

> :kind Array (Array Int)
Type
----

When `:kind <type>` returns `Type`, you may rest assured you are dealing with a fully realized type.
If it returns `Type -> Type`, it is awaiting one type argument in order to be fully realized.
If it says `Type -> Type -> Type`, it means it is awaiting for two more type
arguments in order to be fully realized, and so on and so forth.

== repl on fail

When a build fails we can't even start the REPL.
Sometimes a scratchpad project is re-created with approximately the same dependencies to try to debug and/or figure the problem out.
